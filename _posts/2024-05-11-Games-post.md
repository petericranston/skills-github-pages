# Pong

The first game that I created was Pong. It is famous for being one of the original video games that people played. It was wildly popular in the 70s. It is relatively simple to create and posed was an interesting project for me to create. 
I used a few different techniques to make the code as efficient and understandable as possible. One of the main ones being variable containers for the ball, paddle and AI paddle. This was handy for making it clear what objects I was working with. I also used functions for the different aspects of the game. For example, ball movement, collisions, paddle movement, AI paddle movement etc. This was handy to make the code look clean and understandable. The final game works essentially the same as the original game. However my game is unbeatable.
