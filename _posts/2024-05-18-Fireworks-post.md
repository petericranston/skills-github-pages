# Fireworks

In class, we created a fireworks program, that when you click down on your mouse, a firework animation will play on the mouse position. It was quite complicated and required a few different functions and classes to work correctly. I attempted to create a function where a firework would explode from another one using an array that would store all the firework particles and choose one at random to create another firework animation from, however it did not work as planned and after a fair amount of trial and error and researching, I was unable to get it working. 

However, the core program is interesting in itself so I will display that.
