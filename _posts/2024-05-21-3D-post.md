## 3D Programs

In class we delved in 3D geometries and by the end, we created a [Rotating Cube](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Geometries/index.html), that changes size depending on mouse position. It also changes colour as it rotates. The cube doesn't do much more than that but it's interesting to be working with 3D.

I followed a few tutorials and created some different programs. One of which was the [flying rectangle](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Flying%20Rectangle/index.html). This program is similar to the cube but just uses the mouse X and Y position in a different way. Another small program was a [floating and rotating ring](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Torus/index.html)
I just used WEBGL so the program knows that I am working in 3D and then use the translate and rotate function to make the object do various things. 
The code for all of these programs is not very complicated at the moment, here is the code for the ring, the other programs are a similar size.
```
let angle = 1;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400, WEBGL);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);

  rectMode(CENTER);
  noStroke();
  fill(0, 0, 255);

  rotateX(angle);
  rotateY(angle * 0.2);
  rotateZ(angle * 1.4);

  torus(150, 20);

  angle += 0.07;
}
```

# Working with light and Material

The first program uses the "pointLight" function to illuminate a sphere in an interesting way. There is a fixed red light on the right side of the sphere and a blue light that is controlled by the mouse position. [See program here](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/Light%20and%20Material/index.html)

The next program uses the "directionalLight" function to illuminate a torus. The light is still controlled by the mouse position. I used a vector to make the direction of the light a bit more simple. The material is white so the colour determination is purely based on the light that is shined on the object.

# Importing OBJ Model

Finally, I downloaded a OBJ model of a dog from the internet and imported into my program. I then made it
