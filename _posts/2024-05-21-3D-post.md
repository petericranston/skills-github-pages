# 3D Programs

In class we delved in 3D geometries and by the end, we created a [Rotating Cube](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Geometries/index.html), that changes size depending on mouse position. It also changes colour as it rotates. The cube doesn't do much more than that but it's interesting to be working with 3D.
