# 3D Programs

In class we delved in 3D geometries and by the end, we created a [Rotating Cube](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Geometries/index.html), that changes size depending on mouse position. It also changes colour as it rotates. The cube doesn't do much more than that but it's interesting to be working with 3D.

I followed a few tutorials and created some different programs. One of which was the [flying rectangle](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Flying%20Rectangle/index.html). This program is similar to the cube but just uses the mouse X and Y position in a different way. Another small program was a [floating and rotating ring](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Torus/index.html) The code for all of these programs is not very complicated at the moment, here is the code for the ring, the other programs are a similar size.
```
let angle = 1;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400, WEBGL);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);

  rectMode(CENTER);
  noStroke();
  fill(0, 0, 255);

  rotateX(angle);
  rotateY(angle * 0.2);
  rotateZ(angle * 1.4);

  torus(150, 20);

  angle += 0.07;
}
```
