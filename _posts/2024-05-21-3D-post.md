# 3D Programs

In class we delved in 3D geometries and by the end, we created a [Rotating Cube](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Geometries/index.html), that changes size depending on mouse position. It also changes colour as it rotates. The cube doesn't do much more than that but it's interesting to be working with 3D.

I followed a few tutorials and created some different programs. One of which was the [flying rectangle](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Flying%20Rectangle/index.html). This program is similar to the cube but just uses the mouse X and Y position in a different way. Another small program was a [floating and rotating ring](/skills-github-pages/All%20Projects/Classwork/3D%20Torus/index.html)
