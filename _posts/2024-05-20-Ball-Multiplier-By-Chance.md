# Ball Multiplier by chance

<img src="/skills-github-pages/Images/BallMultiplier.png" alt="Image o" width="50%">


I created this program from an instagram add I saw a few days ago in which a bunch of balls were colliding with each other and the walls and they had a 25% chance of either creating a new ball or deleting one. I thought it was interesting and wouldn't be too challenging of a project, and many painful hours later, here we are. The program as a whole works well and as I had hoped, however there are a few bugs.
